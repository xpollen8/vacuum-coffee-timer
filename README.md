I make my coffee using a Vacuum Brewing System.

My particular preference is for the brew time to be precisely 90 seconds.

Oftentimes, the outcome of my brewing is inconsistent, due to my
sloppy timing of the brew step.

So, I wrote this silly timer app.

This was more an exercise in learning more about React
and CSS animations and SVG. Written using the fabulous nextjs, which allows
for simple deployment using the 'now' command.
